# RealHand-Python-SDK

## Overview
RealHand Python SDK

[English](README.md)

## Caution
- Please ensure that the dexterous hand is not running any other control methods, such as real_hand_sdk_ros, motion capture glove control, or other topics    controlling the hand, to avoid conflicts.
- Please secure the dexterous hand to prevent it from falling during movement.
- Please ensure the dexterous hand's power and USB-to-CAN connection are correct.

## Installation
&ensp;&ensp;You can run the examples after installing the dependencies in requirements.txt. Only Python 3 is supported.
- download

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/realhand-dev/realhand-python-sdk.git
```

- install

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## PCAN (Regular CAN) Driver Install Guide for Windows
1. Download the PEAK driver package
Open: `https://www.peak-system.com/quick/DL-Driver-E`
2. Extract and run the installer
Unzip: `PEAK-System_Driver-Setup.zip`
Run: `PeakOemDrv.exe`
Follow the prompts (installs the device driver and PCAN-Basic DLLs)
3. Plug in the adapter
Connect the PCAN USB adapter after installation
Windows should detect it and finish driver setup
Device Manager should show PCAN-USB (not Unknown Device)
4. Verify (optional)
Open PCAN-View (if installed)
Confirm the channel appears (e.g., `PCAN_USBBUS1`)

If it still shows “Unknown Device”:
- Re-run the installer and ensure PCAN-Basic is selected.
- Try a different USB port and reboot if prompted.

Python example (python-can):
```python
import can
bus = can.interface.Bus(interface="pcan", channel="PCAN_USBBUS1", bitrate=1000000)
```

## Windows GUI Run
After installing dependencies and the CAN adapter driver:
1. Open RealHand/config/setting.yaml
2. Change CAN from "can0" to "PCAN_USBBUS1"
3. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell in the repo root.
4. Run:
```bash
$ python3 example/gui_control/gui_control.py
```

## RS485 Protocol Switching (Currently supports O6/L6/L10. For other models, please refer to the MODBUS RS485 protocol document)

Edit the config/setting.yaml configuration file and modify the parameters according to the comments inside. Set MODBUS: "/dev/ttyUSB0", meaning the "modbus" parameter in the configuration file should be "/dev/ttyUSB0". The USB-RS485 converter usually appears as /dev/ttyUSB* or /dev/ttyACM* on Ubuntu. 
modbus: "None" or "/dev/ttyUSB0"
```bash
# Ensure requirements.txt dependencies are installed
# Install system-level related drivers
$ pip install minimalmodbus --break-system-packages
$ pip install pyserial --break-system-packages
$ pip install pymodbus --break-system-packages
# View the USB-RS485 port number
$ ls /dev
# You should see a port similar to ttyUSB0. Grant permissions to the port:
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
# GUI control example
$ python3 example/gui_control/gui_control.py

```
